# HishBoard_v1
This is a repo for my new gaming keyboard, which will include all files (eventually =) )

The Board is done using KiCad and is designed to meet my special requirements:
  1. Wireless (Hence ESP32)
  2. Can switch automatically between 3 devices that are saved on the board
  3. Mechanical Switches (Blue in My Case)
  4. Using 3.7V Batteries (chargable), to not have to buy new one-time use batteries all the time

What is missing:
  1. 3D CAD File (todo)
  2. Arduino Code (todo)
  3. Materials List

Some Pictures:
